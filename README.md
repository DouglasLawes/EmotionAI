# EmotionAI
EmotionAI.m is part of an individual project outside of University studies I pursued during the summer of 2020 where I used MatLab documentation to produce a transitional neural network model that identifies emotion from a live audio feed. This followed on from a transitional neural network model for the identification of animals from images using datasets I acquired from a popular repository. Notably sections of the code are referencing MatLab documentation so are not my property.
